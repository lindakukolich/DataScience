## SubjectAve.txt

This data set presents a set of average values derived from the "Human Activity
Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" (HAR) described briefly here and more
fully below. The original dataset presents data collected from Cellphone
accelerometers and gyroscopes while each of 30 people (experimental subjects)
performed each of 6 actions: laying down, sitting, standing, walking, walking
downstairs, and walking upstairs. This data was processed to generate 561
features derived from the raw readings given by the embedded accelerometer and
gyroscope in the cellphone. These features were created by processing 2.56
seconds worth of raw samples at a time, allowing use of such functions as mean
and standard deviation to present a smoothed version of the time varying data
that was collected.

The SubjectAve data set works with the 33 means and 33 standard deviation values
from the HAR dataset. These HAR data columns were selected based on their
data.frame column names, which included either "mean()" or "std()". For each of
these columns, all the rows that share a subject and activity label are averaged
to give an entry in the SubjectAve dataset, with all 66 columns plus the subect
and activity label providing a full data.frame row. With 30 subjects and 6
activity, this produces 180 rows in the SubjectAve dataset, with 68 columns for
the 2 labels and 66 data variables.

A word about units. The original HAR data set was normalized to bring all the
measurements between -1 and 1. The connection to the original units, thus, has
been lost for the purpose of the SubjectAve dataset. That said, Acc and Gravity
measurements will be in terms of length/(time * time) and the Jerk measurements
are in terms of length/(time * time * time)

## Data Dictionary

- subject: Integer [1:30] indicating the subject who provided the data for this
row.
- activity: One of 6 activities engaged in for this row. One of "LAYING",
"SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"

The remaining variables are average values of the mean and standard deviations
of each measurement taken for each subject and activity. That is, all of a
single subject's data for a given activity are averaged, one average value for
each sensor in each dimension (X, Y, Z) is calculated.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

## For each record it is provided:

======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:

=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 

======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
